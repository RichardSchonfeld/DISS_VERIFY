### Some reasons why this is a good thing how to sell:

- Academic institutions having their name smeared by fake bad candidates (someone who fakes their diploma will likely not be a great reflection of what someone like who studied there should actually be)
- Other students feeling their legitimate degrees are undervalued: why study for numerous years and pay a ton of money if you can just take a shortcut

### How to sign a person
- Will require some government ID verification
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">How will I ensure people aren't too defensive and that privacy is considered?</mark> - we use some privacy features for this
	- Each user gets a public key, <u>ensures uniqueness</u>
		- Every public key can pertain to only 1 govt. ID
		- Each public key 
	- We can also include some partial-privacy feature that will ensure the company the candidate is registered as who he claims he is, i.e. some partical reveal of privacy like the number f their ID card e.g.
	- <u>Look into: onfido, jumio</u>

### How to sign an entity
- Submit proof of government registration, accreditation document
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Maybe ask for help here?</mark>


### How to read the document
- As a requesting entity you scan a <u>QR code</u> included in the CV
- You can also find the person <u>manually</u>
	- **When request is made:**
		- User receives notice, and has to sign the transaction with their private key
		- Transaction completes and the requester can see the 'approved' or 'signed' status for that profile
			- This is signed as a transaction <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">--need to figure this out what it will contain exactly as payload--</mark> but it would make sense to have some kind of encryption with a hidden message using the requester's private key

### Potential "cool features":

- ZKPs that can tell if a person has met a threshold for grades for example without revealing the entire transcript
