- Npm webpack etc. is a problem
- I want to collect fees, and let people load up balance into their wallet? maybe

Althought most of the stuff can be hadled by JS and WILL be because of easy integration with wallets and so on
- Allowing users to deposit their finances directly into the app will require some more backend stuff and I just don't have the knowledge in PureJS to get this done, I need the layer separation

- The smart contract can also take care of the deletion of the document from IPFS and I can use some maybe homomorphic properties there for both parties to be eligible for access which may be significantly easier in python
