### **Proposition 1: Digital Signature for Key Fragment Authorization**

**Concept**: Before any key fragment is accessed or decrypted, the user must digitally sign a request to authorize access. This approach ensures that even if key fragments are stored on the server, they cannot be accessed or decrypted without the user’s explicit authorization, which is tied to their private key.

### **Detailed Implementation:**

#### **1. Storing Key Fragments:**

When a key fragment is created (during the Shamir secret sharing process), it is encrypted and stored securely. However, rather than simply storing the encrypted fragment, we add an extra layer of protection by requiring user authorization each time a fragment is accessed.

**Example Workflow**:

- **User Registration/Claim Creation**:
    - After the Shamir secret sharing process, you split the key into fragments.
    - Each fragment is encrypted using the intended recipient's public key (e.g., user, Dapp, authority).
    - The encrypted fragments are then stored in the database along with metadata like the recipient’s public key and the fragment’s identifier.

#### **2. Accessing Key Fragments:**

When the user needs to access or use a key fragment (e.g., to decrypt some data or perform an operation), the Dapp first requires the user to sign a challenge with their private key.

**Workflow for Accessing a Fragment**:

- **User Requests Access**:
    
    - The user attempts to access a key fragment (e.g., to decrypt a stored piece of data).
    - The server generates a unique challenge (e.g., a nonce or a timestamp) and sends it to the user.
- **User Signs the Challenge**:
    
    - The user’s Dapp prompts them to sign the challenge with their private key (e.g., using MetaMask for Web3 users or a locally stored private key for Django users).
    - The signed challenge is sent back to the server.
- **Server Verifies the Signature**:
    
    - The server verifies the signed challenge using the user’s public key.
    - If the signature is valid, the server decrypts the corresponding key fragment and either returns it to the user or uses it to perform the requested operation (e.g., decrypting data).
